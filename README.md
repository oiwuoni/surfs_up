## Overview of the analysis. 
The purpose of this analysis was to examine the temperatures recorded for the months of June and December on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. 
## Results.
1. From the two deliverables we can see that the mean temperature for the month of June was greater than for the month of December. 
2. We can also see that the standard deviation of temperatures was lower for the month of June than for the month of December. 
3. Finally, we can see that the minimum temperature for the month of June was higher than the minimum temperature for the month of December.

## Summary.
Overall, we can see that June was a warmer month than December, based on the mean and maximum temperatures provided, although it should be noted that there were more recorded observations performed for the month of June than for December. Two other queries that I would perform for these two months would be to determine the amount of precipitation that was observed for each month, and then to find out the number of stations that were collecting temperature observations for each month.
